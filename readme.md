# Project 5 - Data visualization and reporting in Streamlit - 

*Ferdi / Edgar / Mathieu*
*[DA, Paris & 06/22]*

## Description 

This project served the purpose to put into action our newly acquired and further practiced skills in data processesing and data cleaning, applying statistical knowledge and principals and presenting those in form of data visualzations (frequency distributions etc.), crosstabs, pivots and results of hypothesis tests.

The dataset we used summarized observations about different medical measurements of over 78000 patients in over 140 different hospitals. Among the observations were e.g. information about the patients source of admission, hart rate, glucose level, their disease, case of death etc.

In order to present the results of our analysis in a user freindly we used the streamlit library to create a dashboard like website where the user can look at genereal information about patients in the observed hospitals as well as choose certain diseases which he wnats more information about

## Plan
- decide what domain and database to work on
- use jira software and the kandam board to plan out project
- start data cleaning process together
- deviding analysis work between group members
- preparing streamlit code in spider and setting up dashboard
- merging together multiple set up files and working on final code
- deploying the streamlit board on Heroku

## Deliverables

- original data in csv and excel format
- cleaning code
- clean data in csv format
- multiple data analysis codes from different group members
- python code with streamlit presenation
- slides for presentation
